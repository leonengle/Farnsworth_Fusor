        "# SSH/TCP Hybrid Communication System - Target Codebase Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the SSH/TCP hybrid communication system for the Farnsworth Fusor project, focusing on the target (Raspberry Pi) codebase implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose\n",
        "The SSH/TCP hybrid system implements bidirectional communication as specified in the project diagram:\n",
        "- **SSH for Commands**: Host sends control commands to target (LED_ON, LED_OFF)\n",
        "- **TCP for Data**: Target sends sensor data to host every 1 second\n",
        "- **Bidirectional Communication**: Complete implementation of the SSH datalink verification\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture Benefits\n",
        "- **SSH Commands**: Secure, authenticated control commands\n",
        "- **TCP Data**: Fast, efficient sensor data transmission\n",
        "- **No Port Conflicts**: Separate protocols for different data types\n",
        "- **Reliable Communication**: Best of both protocols\n"
