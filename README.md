# 🚀 Farnsworth Fusor Control System

Codebase which implements an automated startup & shutdown sequence, data acquisition system, and manual control of a Farnsworth Fusor.

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Raspberry Pi Only**

**This project is designed exclusively for Raspberry Pi environments.** It includes external libraries that only work within the Raspberry Pi ecosystem:

- **RPi.GPIO**: Raspberry Pi GPIO control
- **pigpio**: Advanced Raspberry Pi GPIO operations
- **spidev**: Raspberry Pi SPI communication
- **Hardware-specific dependencies**: ADC, motor control, and sensor interfaces

**This project will NOT run on Windows, macOS, or other Linux distributions** due to these hardware-specific dependencies.

## 🎯 Quick Start (Recommended)

**First, clone and enter the project:**
```
git clone https://github.com/leonengle/Farnsworth_Fusor/
cd Farnsworth_Fusor
```

**Test if everything works:**
```
# Test your environment
make test-env
```

**Then use the Makefile for everything!** It's much easier than remembering complex commands:

```
# First time setup (do this once)
make dev

# Run the application
make run

# Check your code before committing
make check

# Clean up when done
make clean
```

**⚠️ Important:** You must be inside the `Farnsworth_Fusor` directory to use `make` commands!

## 📋 Complete Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/leonengle/Farnsworth_Fusor/
cd Farnsworth_Fusor
```

**🔍 Verify you're in the right directory:**
```
# You should see the Makefile
ls Makefile

# If you see "Makefile", you're in the right place!
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate Virtual Environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Complete Development Setup
```
make dev
```

This single command:
- Installs all dependencies
- Sets up pre-commit hooks
- Configures development tools
- Runs initial checks

### 5. Test Everything Works
```
# Test your environment
make test-env

# Run the application
make run
```

**Expected test results:**
- ✅ **Before setup**: Some commands may fail (missing dependencies)
- ✅ **After setup**: All commands should work perfectly
- ✅ **File structure**: All required files should be present

## 🔄 Daily Development Workflow

```
# Start your day
make test-env            # Test environment
make run                 # Run the application

# While developing
make quick-check         # Quick code check (format + lint)

Pre-commit hooks will automatically run when you commit changes. If any checks fail, fix the issues and commit again.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Test Everything First**
```
# Test your environment
make test-env

# Clean and reinstall if needed
make clean
make dev
```

**Expected test results:**
- ✅ **Before setup**: Some commands may fail (normal - missing dependencies)
- ✅ **After setup**: All commands should work perfectly
- ❌ **File missing**: Check if you're in the right directory

### **Common Errors while implementing your virtual environment**

#### **1) PySimpleGUI Installation Issues**
**NOTE: PySimpleGUI is hosted on a private PyPI server. If you're using the old version, it is recommended to get the private version of the library since it is more up-to-date and maintained. The user is required to run these commands to uninstall any existing versions for this project:**
```
python -m pip uninstall PySimpleGUI
python -m pip cache purge
```

#### **2) Raspberry Pi Installation Issues**
**⚠️ CRITICAL: This project ONLY works on Raspberry Pi!**

**NOTE: To install any library on RPi, don't use pip because you will get the following:**

<img width="438" height="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fb0b4df-e1db-43d6-99c5-16a5e9ce0754" />

**Use "sudo apt install..." to install any external libraries.**

For hardware libraries:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pigpio python3-rpi.gpio python3-spidev python3-dev
```

**If you're trying to run this on Windows/macOS/Linux (non-RPi):**
- The project will fail with import errors for RPi.GPIO, pigpio, and spidev
- These libraries are Raspberry Pi-specific and cannot be installed on other systems
- You must use a Raspberry Pi to run this project

#### **3) Dependency Issues**
```
# Clean install
make clean
make dev

# Or manual install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **4) Pre-commit Issues**
```
# Run pre-commit manually
make pre-commit-all

# Or fix specific issues
make format    # Fix formatting
make lint      # Check linting issues
```

## 📚 Documentation Strategy

### **Jupyter Notebook Documentation**

The team uses **Jupyter Notebooks** for comprehensive project documentation and analysis. This approach provides:

- **Interactive Documentation**: Rich text formatting with markdown, code examples, and visual diagrams
- **Technical Analysis**: Detailed system architecture explanations and implementation status
- **Visual Communication**: ASCII diagrams and flowcharts for complex system interactions
- **Version Control**: Notebooks are tracked in Git for collaborative documentation updates

### **Current Documentation**

- **`ssh_tcp_analysis.ipynb`**: Complete analysis of the SSH/TCP hybrid communication system
  - System architecture overview
  - Communication flow diagrams
  - Implementation status tracking
  - Network configuration details

### **Documentation Standards**

- **Markdown-Only Cells**: Documentation notebooks use markdown cells exclusively for clean, readable text
- **No Code Execution**: Documentation notebooks contain no executable code to ensure portability
- **Professional Formatting**: Consistent use of headers, bullet points, tables, and code blocks
- **Visual Diagrams**: ASCII art diagrams for system architecture visualization

### **Creating New Documentation**

When adding new documentation:

1. **Create a new `.ipynb` file** in the project root
2. **Use markdown cells only** - no code execution cells
3. **Follow naming convention**: `[topic]_analysis.ipynb`
4. **Include comprehensive sections**:
   - Overview and purpose
   - Technical details
   - Implementation status
   - Visual diagrams (ASCII)
   - Next steps or conclusions

### **Documentation Dependencies**

The following packages are included in `requirements.txt` for notebook functionality:

- **`jupyter`**: Core Jupyter notebook functionality
- **`ipykernel`**: Python kernel for notebook execution
- **`notebook`**: Jupyter notebook interface

## 📝 Development Notes

- **Virtual Environment**: Always work within the virtual environment
- **Code Style**: Black formatting with 88-character line length
- **Testing**: Run `make test-env` before committing
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Documentation**: Use Jupyter notebooks for technical documentation and analysis
